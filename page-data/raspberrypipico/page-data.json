(Thisâ€¦","html":"<h1>Raspberry pico tetris using st7735 and micro python</h1>\n<p>The Original idea for this project was to emulate the simple tetris programs found for <a href=\"https://blog.withcode.uk/2016/12/microbit-tetris-in-python/\">Micro:bit</a>. (<a href=\"https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/pico\">This probably would have been better implemented using pico display pack</a> and learn something about the Raspberry pi pico board. I knew I needed a pair of buttons; a screen and micro controller. I could then split the programming into 3 tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buttons and events</li>\n<li>Screen and graphic rendering</li>\n<li>Game logic and loops</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a neophyte with limited electronics, MicroPython and raspberry pi pico knowledge I started off following <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-book-get-started-with-micropython-on-raspberry-pi-pico/\">Get started with MicroPython on raspberry pi pico</a>. I thought this would give pointers for the code needed to control both the buttons and screen.</p>\n<h2>Buttons bounce (or debounce) who new?</h2>\n<p>Well, everybody but me apparently. Following the text for IRQ buttons I wired buttons and started writing code examples. I immediately found problems, the examples did not work as expected with LEDs either not lighting or staying on. There were three issues: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/downloads/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcW9SIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--6dc8e90235a820703b1ce14d62cf4999c2e02c49/210226%20Get%20Started%20with%20Micropython%20Errata.pdf\">Errata in the book</a> </li>\n<li>Firmware for the board <a href=\"https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/\">https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/</a>)</li>\n<li>buttons bouncing. The former were fixed by making sure all a pull_down constant was included in all button initiation statements.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pin(15, Pin.OUT, Pin.PULL_DOWN)\nThe latter button debounce was bit more involved. Button bouncing results in an oscillation of voltage caused by button making contacts connecting several times during a press or release of button. The fix is either smoothing circuity or more usually timing lags or looping counts in the program. An elegant solutionand description included in <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/debouncer-library-python-circuitpython-buttons-sensors\">Adafruit debouce libraires</a> however this is circuit python and had a few more decencies to unpick than the this weekend coding project would allow. So I plumped for the time delay implemented in the buttons class.</p>\n<h3>ST7735 screen</h3>\n<p>For this project used the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07N6FQ5XW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\">MakerHawk TFT LCD Screen 1.8inch Graphic Color Screen</a></p>\n<p>Originally I naively though I could just pick the SPI examples in <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-book-get-started-with-micropython-on-raspberry-pi-pico/\">Get started with MicroPython on raspberry pi pico</a>, however nothing happened. Looking at C code supplied with the ST7735 together with,at least to me, the obtuse documentation on the screen itself two thing were apparent: You need a font library file and pins other than SPI pins to switch between command and data sent between the pico board to the screen. A search for with google exposed elegant libraries from Adafruit but these were circuit python with a string of dependencies that would need conversion  I discovred as I chased through the libraries. In this case I picked the libraries of <a href=\"https://github.com/boochow/MicroPython-ST7735\">boochow</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/GuyCarver/MicroPython/blob/master/lib/\">GuyCarver</a> as this would need a small amount of hacking to include the machine pins modules. an issue still remains with this driver the init functions, I used initg since it mostly worked. but it still needs some hacking to remove a a 1 pixel screen shift around the edge of the screen.</p>\n<h3>Game logic and loop</h3>\n<p>Although I originally though micro:bit would be good fit game logic I quickly released that several articles on the <a href=\"\">pygame module and tetris</a> <a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/writing-tetris-in-python-2a16bddb5318\">https://levelup.gitconnected.com/writing-tetris-in-python-2a16bddb5318</a>) were a much better fit. The main recoding here was to replace the pygame libraries with those of the ST7735 used to render the blocks and text.</p>\n<h2>Parts</h2>\n<p>LED x2 Buttons x2 330Kohm x2 Screen ST7735</p>\n<h2>Pinouts</h2>\n<p>Screen\nST7735 Driver |Pico |ST7735 Board ---------------------------------------------------------|-------------- SPI<em>SCK = 10 # sck | SPI1</em>SCK (GP10) | SCK SPI<em>SDO = 11 # mosi(Controller SDO) | SPI</em>TX (GP11) | SDA SPI<em>DC = 3 # aDC | GP3 | DC SPI</em>RS = 2 # aReset | GP2 | RS SPI_CS = 4 # ACS | GP4 | CS VCC VCC VCC GND GND GND</p>\n<p>Buttons and LED GPIO\nled = 15 led2 = 18 BTN<em>LEFT = 19 BTN</em>RIGHT = 14</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<p>SEE: <a href=\"https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/Pico-R3-A4-Pinout.pdf\">https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/Pico-R3-A4-Pinout.pdf</a> SEE <a href=\"https://www.oshwa.org/a-resolution-to-redefine-spi-signal-names/\">https://www.oshwa.org/a-resolution-to-redefine-spi-signal-names/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/tom_games2.html\">https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/tom_games2.html</a> <a href=\"https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/game-development-with-python/tetris-pygame/tutorial-2/\">https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/game-development-with-python/tetris-pygame/tutorial-2/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.101computing.net/bbc-microbit-tetris-game/\">https://www.101computing.net/bbc-microbit-tetris-game/</a> <a href=\"https://blog.withcode.uk/2016/12/microbit-tetris-in-python/\">https://blog.withcode.uk/2016/12/microbit-tetris-in-python/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/get-started-with-micropython-on-raspberry-pi-pico\">https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/get-started-with-micropython-on-raspberry-pi-pico</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07N6FQ5XW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07N6FQ5XW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1</a> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TnI11iVNIAmHYrTuW_EMTs_RG-VNEeyI\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TnI11iVNIAmHYrTuW_EMTs_RG-VNEeyI</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Raspberry pico tetris using st7735 and micro python","date":"2021, Mar 11","tags":["ST7735","Rasberry Pi Pico"],"img":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/raspberrypipico/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-i-rest/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I Rest From Work","tags":["Holidays","Hawaii"],"img":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2976ff59f8f22ab7ff374fdcaad644df/f3dc5/i-rest.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2976ff59f8f22ab7ff374fdcaad644df/7284f/i-rest.jpg 750w,\n/static/2976ff59f8f22ab7ff374fdcaad644df/29ba9/i-rest.jpg 1080w,\n/static/2976ff59f8f22ab7ff374fdcaad644df/f3dc5/i-rest.jpg 1280w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2976ff59f8f22ab7ff374fdcaad644df/57584/i-rest.webp 750w,\n/static/2976ff59f8f22ab7ff374fdcaad644df/984df/i-rest.webp 1080w,\n/static/2976ff59f8f22ab7ff374fdcaad644df/f121e/i-rest.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.66640625}}}}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
