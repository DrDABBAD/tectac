 # Raspberry pico tetris using st7735 and micro python
The Original idea for this project was to emulate the simple tetris programs found for [Micro:bit](https://blog.withcode.uk/2016/12/microbit-tetris-in-python/). ([This probably would have been better implemented using pico display pack](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/pico) and learn something about the Raspberry pi pico board. I knew I needed a pair of buttons; a screen and micro controller. I could then split the programming into 3 tasks:

* Buttons and events
* Screen and graphic rendering
* Game logic and loops

As a neophyte with limited electronics, MicroPython and raspberry pi pico knowledge I started off following [Get started with MicroPython on raspberry pi pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-book-get-started-with-micropython-on-raspberry-pi-pico/). I thought this would give pointers for the code needed to control both the buttons and screen.

## Buttons bounce (or debounce) who new?
Well, everybody but me apparently. Following the text for IRQ buttons I wired buttons and started writing code examples. I immediately found problems, the examples did not work as expected with LEDs either not lighting or staying on. There were three issues: 
1) [Errata in the book](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/downloads/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcW9SIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--6dc8e90235a820703b1ce14d62cf4999c2e02c49/210226%20Get%20Started%20with%20Micropython%20Errata.pdf) 
2) Firmware for the board https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/)
3) buttons bouncing. The former were fixed by making sure all a pull_down constant was included in all button initiation statements.

Pin(15, Pin.OUT, Pin.PULL_DOWN)
The latter button debounce was bit more involved. Button bouncing results in an oscillation of voltage caused by button making contacts connecting several times during a press or release of button. The fix is either smoothing circuity or more usually timing lags or looping counts in the program. An elegant solutionand description included in [Adafruit debouce libraires](https://learn.adafruit.com/debouncer-library-python-circuitpython-buttons-sensors) however this is circuit python and had a few more decencies to unpick than the this weekend coding project would allow. So I plumped for the time delay implemented in the buttons class.

### ST7735 screen
For this project used the [MakerHawk TFT LCD Screen 1.8inch Graphic Color Screen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07N6FQ5XW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Originally I naively though I could just pick the SPI examples in [Get started with MicroPython on raspberry pi pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-book-get-started-with-micropython-on-raspberry-pi-pico/), however nothing happened. Looking at C code supplied with the ST7735 together with,at least to me, the obtuse documentation on the screen itself two thing were apparent: You need a font library file and pins other than SPI pins to switch between command and data sent between the pico board to the screen. A search for with google exposed elegant libraries from Adafruit but these were circuit python with a string of dependencies that would need conversion  I discovred as I chased through the libraries. In this case I picked the libraries of [boochow](https://github.com/boochow/MicroPython-ST7735) and [GuyCarver](https://github.com/GuyCarver/MicroPython/blob/master/lib/) as this would need a small amount of hacking to include the machine pins modules. an issue still remains with this driver the init functions, I used initg since it mostly worked. but it still needs some hacking to remove a a 1 pixel screen shift around the edge of the screen.

### Game logic and loop
Although I originally though micro:bit would be good fit game logic I quickly released that several articles on the [pygame module and tetris]() https://levelup.gitconnected.com/writing-tetris-in-python-2a16bddb5318) were a much better fit. The main recoding here was to replace the pygame libraries with those of the ST7735 used to render the blocks and text.
