3D printers typically work by melting plastic  and then depositing the melt layer upon layer to form an object. There are essentially Two types FDM (Filament-based) and SLA (Resin-based).

## Requirements

Cheap,fast (accurate/precise) not smelly nosey or toxic. Although of course 3D printing is long and slow compared to other methods of production.

## What I want to make

Two projects in embryonic stages:

* Hydroponics so casing for

In addition

* Print broken bit for vacuum cleaner company that does not make spare parts and instructs sub contractor to break mold's and probably support brexit.

## 3d plastics

Requirements: Don't smell No noise

Materials:
PLA (Polylactic Acid): this is produced from vegetable extract
ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene):
PETG:
Wood Filled:
PVA: Dissolves in water is used as a support material for complex prints.

## Risks with 3D printing

Since 3d printer typically work by heating the plastic to melt it releases volatile compounds, some of which from ultrafine particles that are emitted into the air near the printer and the object.
3D printer hazards include, but are not limited to:

* ultrafine/nano-sized particles Ultra Fine Particles (UFPs);
* Heat and fire (The average temperature is 220C, the temperature of hot oven.);
* Mechanical hazards from moving parts;
* High voltage;
* Ultraviolet light
* Volatile Organic Compounds or VOCs (ex. styrene, acrylonitrile, or formaldehyde, etc.) depending on the media being used.

Both ABS and PLA particles negatively impacted cell viability, with the latter giving a more toxic response although the ABS is likely to emit more particulate matter ( PLA filament emitted 20 billion ultrafine particles per minute, and the ABS emitted up to 200 billion particles per minute). Not sure if there is research there is details on exposure during practical usage.

In addition to risks during manufacture there are also risk with usage.

* ABS plastic,it is not BPA-free (Bisphenol A or 4,4′-(Propane-2,2-diyl)diphenol)
* printing in dots mean surface may not be smooth therefore difficult to clean or give deep sites for bacteria.

## Counter measures

* Operating 3D printers only in well-ventilated areas clear of solvent Hazards
* Setting the nozzle temperature at the lower end of the suggested temperature range for filament materials
* Standing away from operating machines
* Using machines and filaments that have been tested and verified to have low emissions.
* Remote monitoring and control.
* Ensure sufficient number of functioning smoke detectors
* smoke detection and automatic cut off
