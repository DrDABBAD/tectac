top-level programs  with c# 9


##  boilerplate code 
  
A traditional minimum console app,  has the following code:   

```
 using System;
 class Program
 {  
	static void Main(string[] args)  
	{    
		Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");  
	}
 }   
```
 
 
## Is there a simpler way?

Yes, it is known as top-level programs  and is available in  C# 9.
```
using System;
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

No main method no  program class, these are  added during compilation. The can only be one  program file.

## Is it benificial ?

Dont know  
Where are the arguments
