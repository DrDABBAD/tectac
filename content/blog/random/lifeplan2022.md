## Distracted work takes longer to complete.

To blame and complain is lame.
You can only read so many books before you die.
If your phone is near you, it will distract you.
The best reason to say no to extra work: your family.

## How to say no

"I’m taking time off right now and can’t do it."
"Your probably best to talk to \<insert name\\the hand\> about that. They’re a better fit for your request."
"Sorry my calendar is full. When it frees up I’ll let you know."

Bottom line
Life is one, big, fat negotiation. Start with no. Move to a yes if you have to.
