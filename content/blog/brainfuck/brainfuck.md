Brainfuck, language itself, is a Turing-complete language created by Urban MÃ¼ller. The language only consists of 8 operators, yet with the 8 operators, <>+-[],.
Since it is turing complete capable of writing almost any program you can think of.

## The operators
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
\> = increases memory pointer, or moves the pointer to the right 1 block. <br/><br/>

\< = decreases memory pointer, or moves the pointer to the left 1 block.<br/><br/>
\+ = increases value stored at the block pointed to by the memory pointer<br/><br/>
\- = decreases value stored at the block pointed to by the memory pointer<br/><br/>
\[ = like c while(cur_block_value != 0) loop.<br/><br/>
\] = if block currently pointed to's value is not zero, jump back to [<br/><br/>
\, = like c getchar(). input 1 character.<br/><br/>
\. = like c putchar(). print 1 character to the console<br/><br/>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->
## The rules

* Any arbitrary Token besides the 8 listed above should be ignored by a compiler or interpretor.
  Tokens besides the 8 operators should be considered comments.

* All memory blocks on the "array" are set to zero at the beginning of the program. And the memory pointer starts out on the very left most memory block.

* Loops may be nested as many times as you want. But all [ must have a corre- sponding ]. ???????
