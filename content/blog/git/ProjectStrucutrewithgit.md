Git the answer to every question is its just a pointer better explaination of all the bits (https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/5671626-manage-your-code-project-with-git-github/6152251-explore-gits-file-structure).
git view of  the world lives the .git directory  and is usually viewed with git log, git status etc.

So you this is naive title.

Can I have stuff in private git not github?

Only if its not committed i.e. ignored
